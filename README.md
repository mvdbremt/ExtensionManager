# Extension Manager
## What it does
It moves every files in directories depending of the extension ( a .pdf will do in a pdf directory).\
\
Only argument is directory to manage (by default : current directory).\
\
Only works on windows currently (will be changed to be able to work on linux too).
## Why I did it
This is essentially a personnal project I did just for fun and to train.\
Don't hesitate to comment (I tend to forget good pratices, so it would help me). \
It is my first project that I have put on github in public.
